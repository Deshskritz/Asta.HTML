        <H3>Introduction:</H3>
        <p>Set in the Clover Kingdom, a kingdom where magic is everything, magic knights protect the kingdom together with the wizard king.
             there is a village in the common realm named hage, Asta and Yuno are both orphans abandoned in a church in Hage. Yuno is a handsome charismatic young boy overflowing with mana and has tremendous magic.
             <Br />Asta on the other hand is opposite of Yuno, a short and lousy boy without a lick of mana, Asta cannot use magic but he is determined to be the wizard king one day. Asta worked towards his goal everyday despite not being
             able to use magic, he would go in the woods and train his body to be strong despite being just fourteen years old.

        <H3>Asta gets a Grimoire</H3>
        <p>Once a year, all around the clover kingdom, all of the 15-year-olds are gathered and an awarding ceremony is held, where they receive their own grimoire which enhance their magical powers. Asta was always looking forward to this day as he thought
            getting a grimoire will miraculously give him magical powers. It was time for the awarding of grimoires but everyone except Asta received one, in fact Yuno received a four-leaf clover-a very rare legendary grimoire only used by exceptional mages. Despite not getting a grimoire, Asta remained dedicated 
            in being the wizard king and he would go out to train even harder everyday. On the night of the grimoire awarding ceremony, Yuno was making the trip back home when he was stopped by a bandit hoping to steal his four-leaf clover and make a fortune out of it by selling it. Yuno was trapped by the bandit
            and he couldn't do anything because the bandit was strong and already had Yuno chained by his chain magic
